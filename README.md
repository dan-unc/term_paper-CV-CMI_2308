Repository for updates on the term paper for Computer Vision
This project is based on IEEE Paper: Multi-class Assembly Parts Recognition using Composite Feature and Random Forest for Robot Programming by Demonstration
# Aim of this project
Our proposal aims to create a machine vision model, that can be deployed on a single board computer with a camera module, for the purpose
of child part inspection of assembled systems. The model which is trained for inspection of a specific system will be able to classify whether a
unit that has been assembled contains all the required components by identifying the presence of the child parts that it must contain.
